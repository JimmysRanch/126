# Environment Variables

## Spark Configuration

### Required Configuration

#### runtime.config.json
This file contains the Spark application ID and is required for Spark to function properly.

```json
{
  "app": "your-spark-app-id"
}
```

The application ID is used to connect to Spark's key-value store and other services. This file is already configured in the repository.

### Optional Environment Variables

While Spark doesn't require additional environment variables, you may want to configure:

- **Business Settings**: Configure timezone, business hours, and other settings through the Settings page in the application UI
- **Payment Methods**: Configured through Settings page
- **Service Pricing**: Configured through Settings page

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Verify Spark is installed:
   ```bash
   npm ls @github/spark
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Important Configuration Notes

### Timezone Configuration
The application uses business timezone for all date/time operations to prevent timezone-related bugs. Configure the timezone in Settings > Business Information. This timezone affects:

- Appointment scheduling
- Staff schedules
- Transaction timestamps
- All date-based reporting

The default timezone is the browser's timezone if not configured in settings.
